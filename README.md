This is an assesment that we worked on in Comp 331: Natural Language Processing.  For this project, the goal was to use a python deep learning library and a database of both song lyrics and genres to create a program that can write song lyrics.  The length of the lyrics can be adjusted based on the desired amount of words, which is done on line 86 in the for loop.  It was designed not to allow the user to pick the length.  The result was a program that is capable of making songs with a roughly 80% chance of being a coherent song, with the other 20% not being comprehensible
